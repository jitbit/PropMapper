# PropMapper

Property mapper for .NET. Flat and basic, but **VERY FAST**.

Just one cs-file, only 80 lines of code.

## Installation

Drop the cs-file into your project or install via [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PropMapper/)

`Install-Package PropMapper`

## Usage

Just one line of code:

```cs
//instantiating a new object
DestType destObject = PropMapper<SourceType, DestType>.From(srcObj);
```

or

```cs
//using with existing objects
PropMapper<SourceType, DestType>.CopyTo(srcObj, destObj);
```

## Benchmarks

Mapping a simple object with 50 properties, over 100k iterations.

Results:

| Mapper  | Results |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Automapper   | 32490ms  |
| Automapper with cached `config` object | 335ms  |
| **PropMapper**   | **25ms**  |
| Manual code  | 10ms  |

PropMapper is more than 13 times faster. Here's the class we tested on:

```cs
public class Tester
{
	public string prop1 { get; set; }
	public string prop2 { get; set; }
	public string prop3 { get; set; }
	public int iprop1 { get; set; }
	//etc. 50 times
}
```

## Limitations 

The project does not support nested properties at the moment, only first level properties.

## Under the hood

We use compiled Expression trees, created in the static constructor and cached in a var, which makes it really fast.

## Use case

```cs
public class Person
{
	public string FirstName { get; set; }
	public string LastName { get; set; }
}
public class Employee : Person
{
	public string Title { get; set; }
	
	public Employee(Person person)
	{
		PropMapper<Person, Employee>.CopyTo(person, this);
	}
}
```

# What's next?

Currently it's just one C# file, with unit tests, a proper library and more benchmarks coming later. The tool is in heavy use in [other projects](https://www.jitbit.com/) of ours, so it's regularly unit-tested anyway.
